                <h3>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>His manner was not effusive. It seldom was, but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with 
                        a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a 
                        gasogene in the corner.I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a 
                        hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out of it. He was a 
                        remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached, and he was a stranger to me."</p>  
                
                    <p>"He was a man of about thirty, and he was dressed in a long coat of a somewhat unusual cut, and was wearing a soft felt hat. I had
                         been waiting in the shadows for some time, watching this rather strange behavior." " The man who had been sitting by the fire 
                         sprang to his feet. He was a tall, fine-looking man, and his face was pale, though he had
                         been in the room for some time. He had the appearance of a man who had been troubled by some weighty matter."</p>
                
                    </p>
                
                    <p>"As he turned, I saw that his eyes were filled with a strange and anxious look, and I felt a strong sense of unease. Something about 
                        his presence in the room struck me as deeply unsettling." "On the following morning I went over to the little shop in which I had seen Neville St. Clair the previous day. It was in a small, 
                        obscure street, but the shop was not without a certain air of respectability."</p>
                
                    <p>"As I entered, I was greeted by the woman who had been serving in the shop. She appeared to be a middle-aged lady, and her manner was
                         quiet and polite. She was a woman who knew how to keep her composure, even in the face of a difficult situation." "I asked if she had heard anything new about him, but she shook 
                         her head. Her demeanor was a mixture of confusion and fear, and I 
                        could sense that she was hiding something."</p>
                
                    <p>"He sat down beside the fire, and I could see that his mind was in a state of considerable confusion. His eyes were wild, and his 
                        movements were erratic. He seemed to be struggling with something deeply troubling." "'You are sure that he is guilty?' I asked. 'I am sure of it,' said he. 'But, of course, the evidence is circumstantial. It is all 
                        very puzzling, and I am afraid that it may take some time to uncover the truth.'" </p>
                
                    <p>"I could not help but notice the odd expressions that passed over his face as he tried to explain what had happened. His words 
                        were jumbled, and I could sense that he was not being entirely forthcoming."</p>
                
                    <p>"Sherlock Holmes and I had been discussing the strange case of the Red-Headed League, which had baffled us for some time. Holmes
                         had received a letter from a man named Jabez Wilson, a pawnbroker who had been involved in the mysterious organization."</p>
                
                    <p>"The Red-Headed League had suddenly disbanded without explanation, and Wilson was desperate to know why. Holmes 
                        immediately saw through the veil of mystery, and we made our way to Wilson's office."</p>
                
                    <p>"Upon our arrival, we found the office to be modestly furnished, but Holmes’s keen observations revealed subtle clues
                         that led us to a deeper understanding of the case. We quickly deduced that the disappearance of the League was no accident."</p>
